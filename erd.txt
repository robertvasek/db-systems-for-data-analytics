# Task C: Dimensional Model Description

![ERD of star schema](erd.png)

## Fact tables

Based on the relational schema and input data, we identified two main business processes represented by two fact tables: **F_TRACKING** and **F_HEALTH**.

---

### fact_tracking

* type: transaction fact
* grain: one record per GPS tracking event for a given car, driver, and timestamp
* primary key: combination of foreign keys from related dimensions and `pos_key` (degenerate dimension)
* measures:

  * distance – additive
  * driving_time – additive
  * speed – non-additive

This table stores all movement and status events from GPS tracking and is used to analyze vehicle activity and utilization over time.

---

### fact_health

* type: snapshot fact
* grain: one record per application/device health ping for a given car, driver, and timestamp
* primary key: combination of foreign keys from related dimensions and `service_key` (degenerate dimension)
* measures:

  * app_run_time – semi-additive
  * dev_run_time_hr – semi-additive
  * battery_level_pct – non-additive

This table captures device and app performance metrics and allows analysis of reliability, uptime, and battery behavior.

---

## Dimensions

* **dim_date** – static calendar dimension with attributes such as year, month, day, and weekday indicators.
* **dim_car** – vehicle attributes (license_plate, make, color, type, tonnage) with denormalized company data (company_name, city, country, region).
* **dim_driver** – driver details including company assignment; can change over time (SCD2).
* **dim_track_status** – decodes tracking codes (M, _, =, *, #, X, F) into human-readable states.
* **dim_device** – device metadata such as name or manufacturer; can change over time (SCD2).

---

### Degenerate dimensions

* `pos_key` (for tracking)
* `service_key` (for health)

---

### Shared dimensions

* `dim_date`
* `dim_car`
* `dim_driver`

These shared (conformed) dimensions ensure consistent reporting across both fact tables.

This dimensional model captures both fleet tracking and device health processes in a unified star schema. It supports historical analysis, monitoring, and performance evaluation of vehicles, drivers, and application devices.
